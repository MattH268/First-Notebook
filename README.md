Max Temperature in January 2017

Outline:
    
  This project shows the maximum temperatures throughout January of 2017, every other day. It starts on the first of the month and goes to the thirty-first. On the x-axis is the Date (every other day, with odd numbers). On the y-axis is the Temperature, which is measured in degrees Fahrenheit. While temperatures change, the graph shows that most temperatures stay around 35-45 degrees. The highest temperature recorded was 61 degrees, while the lowest was 16 degrees. Generally, in the beginning of the month, temperatures changed more drastically, like from the 5th to the 7th, where the temperature went from 43 to 16 degrees. Towards the end of the month, in general, temperatures stayed more consistent, staying mostly around 40 degrees. At the very end of the month, the temperature dropped to around 30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Conclusions

  This graph shows the maximum temperatures recorded in January 2017, every other day. The x-axis states the Date (every other day, with odd numbered dates). The y-axis states the Temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit. While temperatures vary throughout the month, the graph illustrates that most temperatures stay near 35-45 degrees. The highest temperature measured was 61 degrees, while the lowest was 16 degrees.
